################PREP PART##################################################
# You will need:
# 1. csv from BruinLearn with all the grades
# 2. skills.csv which has random student keys matching their names in an alphabetical order
# 3. studentIDs.csv which has skills and # of times of mastery
# See template files in this folder

# uncomment when in debug mode:
# setwd("Your working directory")
# for example:
# setwd("/Users/Yaqian/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-huangyq@g.ucla.edu/My Drive/p-lab/skgb/demo")

# MUST modify when prompted#
# Download from BruinLearn -> Grades -> Export...
# Load csv with grades
# Replace with your filename:

# multiple ways: but enrolled students will be in a Discussion Section
